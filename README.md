# Tumor-Detection
For a project during my studies, I have worked on subjects concerning tumors segmentation with image processing. This is several methods i used.
I took two images from a patient corresponding to two differents states of the tumor (+4 months).

First method : Binarization & Labelling to count pixel differences.
